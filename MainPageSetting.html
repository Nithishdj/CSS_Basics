            <p>Hi hello evereone, warm welcome to all In a country as linguistically and culturally diverse as India, accessibility tools for individuals with hearing and speech impairments are significantly important. Sign language serves as a primary mode of communication for many individuals with hearing disabilities. However, the lack of universal understanding of Indian Sign Language (ISL) among the general public creates barriers to inclusive communication. This project aims to develop a real-time ISL translator that addresses these challenges by leveraging artificial intelligence. By using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed system identifies static hand signs representing alphabets and digits through a live webcam feed. The identified signs are then translated into text and optionally spoken aloud using text-to-speech (TTS) technology. Furthermore, the text output can be translated into various Indian and international languages using translation APIs, making the tool useful in multilingual settings like public services, classrooms, and hospitals. </p>
