  <h1>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</h1>

  <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a former Indian cricketer and captain, known for his exceptional leadership skills and finishing ability in cricket. Born in Ranchi in 1981, he started his career as a ticket collector and rose to become one of the most iconic cricketers in Indian history.</p>

  <p>Dhoni made his debut in December 2004 against Bangladesh. His aggressive batting style quickly caught attention, and his career took off after his 183* against Sri Lanka in 2005.</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p>He led India to its first-ever ICC T20 World Cup win in 2007, followed by the historic ICC World Cup win in 2011 and ICC Champions Trophy win in 2013 â€” making him the only captain to win all three major ICC trophies.</p>
  </div>

  <p>He was known for backing young talent and trusting his instincts on the field. His calmness under pressure earned him the nickname "Captain Cool."</p>

  <p>In IPL, Dhoni has captained Chennai Super Kings since 2008, leading them to multiple titles. His bond with CSK fans is unparalleled, and the team has become one of the most successful in the league.</p>

  <p>Beyond cricket, Dhoni holds an honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Indian Territorial Army. He is also a successful entrepreneur and has invested in sports, fitness, and agriculture.</p>
